# CAD folder

Here I uploaded the STEP files I exported from my OnShape project.
If you would like to copy the OnShape project for personal use you can look at it [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/070f79a0148a559f77657eaf/w/5755bf2e2ca0199b1df2e981/e/76ee0c3b840582ba5abe58b4?renderMode=0&uiState=698cb544cc50d45bb80dd7d0).

Not much to note here, except, I followed this [useful guide](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/keyboard-guides/tree/master/cases) I found. If it wasn't for this guide, the case would look very different 😅
