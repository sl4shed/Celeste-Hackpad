# Celestepad

![](Keyboard.png)

A custom keypad made for Celeste with KiCad, OnShape and QMK.

# About

I made this project because I wanted a portable way to play Celeste on my phone with decent controls.
It's just a simple keypad which you can plug into your phone.

# Index
I split this up into multiple readmes for simplicity. Feel free to look around the repo or just use this index:
 - [Assembly Guide](/assembly/README.md)
 - [KiCAD Readme](/kicad/README.md)
 - [QMK Readme](/qmk/readme.md)
 - [CAD Readme](/step/README.md)

# Attribution

I used some of the code in [nwii/oledbongocat](https://github.com/nwii/oledbongocat) for my firmware.
